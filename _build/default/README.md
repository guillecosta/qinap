# Qinap

`qinap` is not a parser: it's a (very small) monadic parsing library, heavily inspired by the [`opal`](https://github.com/pyrocat101/opal) library and the article [Monadic Parser Combinators](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf) by Hutton and Meijer. For documentation, look at the interface in the `qinap.mli` file.
